# DSC-180B-Presentation-Website
This repository includes a website for our COVID-19 Infection Risk Estimator. It only includes website components. 


In this project, We propose an application which estimates infection risk of COVID-19 in buildings. The application accepts building data and a set of parameters regarding occupants and infection rates of the surrounding community. Code and assumptions made in the algorithm are clearly explained to users for transparency, which those explainations are included in the project in our last quarter.
